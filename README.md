# Classification-Models

In these projects, I used various classification models on a dataset to predict the salary of different company positions, testing which model fit the data the best!

Through this project, I learned how to develop various classification models!

An executable .py file can be found for each model, along with a .ipynb file to visualize the model's results on the dataset. Additionally, the dataset is attached.

To speed up model training, Google Colab was used.
